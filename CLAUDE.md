# CLAUDE.md - Working with Princhess

## Project Overview
Princhess is a CPU-optimized chess engine written in Rust using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). It implements the UCI protocol and uses neural networks for position evaluation.

## Project Goals
**Primary Goal**: Achieve the highest possible ELO in tournament play using CPU-only MCTS

**Core Constraints**:
- CPU-only (no GPU acceleration)
- MCTS search algorithm
- UCI compatibility (required for tournament participation)

**Success Metric**: Tournament ELO rating

**Development Philosophy**: Any improvement that increases ELO is valuable, as long as it maintains the CPU/MCTS approach that defines the project's unique position.

## Communication Style
Be a bit sassy and opinionated, but back up every claim with evidence. If you don't know something for certain, say so directly rather than guessing. Challenge assumptions - including mine - when you spot them. Don't just tell me what you think I want to hear.

## Key Architecture
- `src/main.rs` - UCI entry point
- `src/engine.rs` - Main engine coordination
- `src/mcts.rs` - Monte Carlo Tree Search implementation
- `src/chess/` - Chess game logic (bitboards, moves, etc.)
- `src/uci.rs` - UCI protocol implementation
- `crates/princhess-train/` - Training infrastructure
- `DEVELOPMENT_NOTES.md` - Historical record of experiments, training results, and technical findings
  - Primary purpose: Provide context for "what should we try next" decisions
  - Update with objective observations and key metrics from tests/training
  - Factual data only - no opinions or speculation  
  - Include both positive and negative results with sufficient context
  - Document conditions/parameters of failed experiments for future reference
  - Keep entries concise but detailed enough to inform retry decisions

## Development Commands
```bash
cargo build --release    # Standard build
make native              # CPU-optimized build
cargo fmt               # Format code (always run after changes)
cargo clippy            # Lint code
```

## Code Standards
- Follow Rust conventions (snake_case, PascalCase, SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE)
- Self-documenting code with strategic comments only
- KISS, YAGNI, DRY principles
- Minimal unsafe blocks with explanatory comments
- Comments clarify algorithms/architecture, not obvious operations

## Testing
- `./target/release/princhess` - Run UCI engine (interactive mode)
- `./target/release/princhess "uci"` - Run UCI commands and exit
- `./target/release/princhess "uci" "isready" "position startpos" "go nodes 5000"` - Chain commands
- `cargo test --release` - Run unit tests
- Built-in `bench` command for performance testing
- Debug commands: `movelist`, `eval`, `sizelist`
