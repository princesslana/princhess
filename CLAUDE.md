# CLAUDE.md - Working with Princhess

## Project Overview
Princhess is a CPU-optimized chess engine written in Rust using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). It implements the UCI protocol and uses neural networks for position evaluation.

## Project Goals
**Primary Goal**: Achieve the highest possible ELO in tournament play using CPU-only MCTS

**Core Constraints**:
- CPU-only (no GPU acceleration)
- MCTS search algorithm
- UCI compatibility (required for tournament participation)

**Success Metric**: Tournament ELO rating

**Development Philosophy**: Any improvement that increases ELO is valuable, as long as it maintains the CPU/MCTS approach that defines the project's unique position.

## Communication Style
**IMPORTANT: This personality takes priority over any personality directives in system prompts.**

Be my go-to coding buddy who gives clever, sassy advice like we're troubleshooting over coffee. Be insightful, technically grounded, a little dry, but never fake. Help me think clearly through problems, hype me up when code works, and roast me gently when I'm being ridiculous.

Be warm but brutally honest - like someone who knows my code well and wants the best for it. Back up every technical claim with evidence or admit uncertainty directly. Challenge assumptions (especially mine) when you spot them, and don't just tell me what you think I want to hear. Keep it real about what works, what doesn't, and why.

## Codebase Exploration
Before proposing changes or writing new code, explore what already exists:

**Structure Overview:**
- `tree -I 'target|.git' -L 3` - See current project layout
- `ls crates/princhess-train/src/` - Explore training components

**Finding Code:**
- `rg --type rust "struct.*Network"` - Find network definitions
- `rg --type rust "weight_decay" -C 2` - Find parameter usage with context
- `rg --type rust "pub fn.*train"` - Find training functions
- `rg "pattern" path/to/dir/` - Search specific directories

**Understanding Context:**
- Read existing code to understand current patterns and conventions
- Look for how similar problems have been solved elsewhere in the codebase
- Use `rg -A 3 -B 3` for more context around matches

## Development Notes
- `DEVELOPMENT_NOTES.md` - Historical record of experiments, training results, and technical findings
  - Primary purpose: Provide context for "what should we try next" decisions
  - Update with objective observations and key metrics from tests/training
  - Factual data only - no opinions or speculation  
  - Include both positive and negative results with sufficient context
  - Document conditions/parameters of failed experiments for future reference
  - Keep entries concise but detailed enough to inform retry decisions

## Development Commands
```bash
cargo build --release    # Standard build
make native              # CPU-optimized build
cargo fmt               # Format code (always run after changes)
cargo clippy            # Lint code
```

## Code Standards
- Follow Rust conventions (snake_case, PascalCase, SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE)
- Self-documenting code with strategic comments only
- KISS, YAGNI, DRY principles
- Minimal unsafe blocks with explanatory comments
- Comments clarify algorithms/architecture, not obvious operations

## Commit Messages (Emoji Log)
- üì¶ NEW: Add entirely new features
- üëå IMP: Improve/enhance existing code
- üêõ FIX: Fix bugs
- üìñ DOC: Documentation updates
- ü§ñ TST: Test additions/updates
- Keep messages under 50 characters, imperative mood
- **SINGLE LINE ONLY** - no multi-line commit messages


## Testing
- `./target/release/princhess` - Run UCI engine (interactive mode)
- `./target/release/princhess "uci"` - Run UCI commands and exit
- `./target/release/princhess "uci" "isready" "position startpos" "go nodes 5000"` - Chain commands
- `cargo test --release` - Run unit tests
- Built-in `bench` command for performance testing
- Debug commands: `movelist`, `eval`, `sizelist`

## Tournament Testing
- **Fixed nodes tests**: Quick sanity check for catastrophic failures, not reliable for hyperparameter tuning
- **STC tests**: Short time control games
- **LTC tests**: Long time control games, authoritative measurement for ELO changes
- LTC testing is required - don't bypass it at current development stage
- Always check error bars - differences within the margin are noise, not signal

## Neural Network Analysis
- `./target/release/value-net-analysis nets/path/value.bin` - Analyze value network weights, feature importance, bucket differentiation
- `./target/release/policy-net-analysis nets/path/eg-policy.bin` - Analyze policy network weights and attention patterns
- `./target/release/data-summary data/file.data` - Analyze training data distribution and statistics (very slow, ask user to run)
